# Info is King!  

But when that information gets **misconstrued** or is only told in half-truths with no citation, it can be hard to know who is telling the full story.

## The Origin of the Claim  

My partner sent me a video asking if it was true or not.  

This video was talking about two iPhone settings you "need to change" to prevent being hacked:  

- **Auto AirPlay** (default: automatic)  
- **Ask to Join Networks** (default: off)  

The video cited a hack described in an April 2025 *Wired* article:  https://www.wired.com/story/airborne-airplay-flaws/

> “Researchers reveal a collection of bugs known as *AirBorne* that would allow any hacker on the same Wi-Fi network as a third-party AirPlay-enabled device to surreptitiously run their own code on it.”  


The problem was that this information was misleading. The information provided was not going to solve the issue at all. It actually only inconveniences the person who does change their settings so that now when they leave their house and come back
their phone wont connect to their wi-fi and they cant use airplay anymore with their personal devices.

They also did not even mention who found the problem, only vuagley said "researchers", didn't mention any article talking about it and never even provided much context except using the word "hackers" to get people to listen.
Giving the information they gave misinformed people and didn't tell them at all what they could actually do to protect themselves from this. Eventually people are going to turn their Airplay back on, and some may even re-adjust their wi-fi settings again.

Without practical understanding of the issue, we remain just as vulnerable. 

## The fix

### First:
#### Update your iPhone.
> Apple has already patched the bug and is looking to further protect users from this problem.
Keeping your device up-to-date is always the best way to stay protected. If you are hearing of a "hack" on the news or from public sources
I guarantee that Apple and other companies already know about and have found a fix. Not very often will they not have an answer.

### Second:
#### Be careful when connecting to any public wi-fi
> This includes grocery stores, airports, pubs, restaurants and even your friends apartment.
All these places that have wi-fi may or may not be protected, and their protection is very much limited.
Public wi-fi is always a risk. It is up to you wether you want to accept it or not.
How can you tell?
Here are some tells of a decent public wi-fi
1. Will have a captive portal
2. May require a purchase to get a unique identifier for login at captive portal
3. Time limits (not common, but prevents bad actors from camping out on it)

### What about bad wi-fi?
1. No password protection (NEVER connect to these, giant red flag)
2. Password protected only, no captive portal (typically it is a basic password and probably just as bad as having no password at all)
3. 2 Wi-fi options with the same name? (one is an evil twin attempting to get you to connect to a false wi-fi option. If you notice this let the location know)

> Any publically available wi-fi is always a risk, just remember that and if all else fails, your phone has a hotspot if you need internet for another device.
If it's your phone you need wi-fi for, sorry but you will just need to find better signal or accept the risk of public wi-fi.

# Misleading content

## Breaking It Down  

To understand how this claim spread, we need to consider three things:  

1. **Social Media**  
2. **Sources**  
3. **Intent**  

---

### 1. Social Media  

Social media is a content-rich space—you can find almost anything depending on the app or site. But most of this content is stripped down and compressed for **mass consumption**.  

We don’t go to TikTok for 10-minute videos on current events. We want it short, sweet, and to the point. The problem is that some topics are too complicated to explain in this format.  

Twitter (or *X*, for the indoctrinated) is one of the biggest sources of false information online. Even with community notes, many people take what they see at face value.  

If we don’t enter these spaces with the right mindset, we risk being led to **false conclusions**—sometimes ones that can cause real harm.  

---

### 2. Sources  

Sources are the most vital part of separating fact from fiction.  

- Where is the information coming from?  
- Did the video or post even provide a source?  
- Was it the whole truth, or just part of it?  

Without a verified source, we can’t know for sure. A video with a voiceover saying “this is what happened…” is not enough.  

Think back to writing school papers—you had to cite your sources. Why? Because you couldn’t just say whatever you wanted. To be believed, you need to show **the truth**, not just “your truth.”  

Humans love to express feelings and beliefs—but misleading others to push those beliefs is where things go wrong.  

---

### 3. Intent  

Intent is about the **end goal**: why are you posting or saying these things?  

Misleading posts are often designed to do just that—**mislead**. The best manipulators know how to spin the truth.  

---

## Spinning the Truth  

Spinning the truth is an **artform**. Here’s the recipe:  

1. Provide just enough credible information on a topic.  
2. Cite a recent verifiable event.  
3. Add your opinion.  
4. Back it up with “evidence”—but without a reliable source.  

This “evidence” could be:  

- A fake or unrelated quote.  
- A cropped video that only shows what supports their claim.  
- A real video with **false context** attached.  

Without a reliable source, “take my word for it, bro” should hold **zero weight**. But many people trust influencers they like, especially if those influencers once provided verifiable information.  

Eventually, when content runs dry, some creators either:  
- Start making things up to keep followers engaged, or  
- Fall victim to misinformation themselves.  

---

## The Bigger Problem  

- **Misquoting**  
- **Partial quoting**  
- **Misrepresenting videos**  
- **Outright fabrications**  

All of it serves the same purpose: misleading people.  

And because social media algorithms only show us what they think we want—rage-bait, affirmation loops, and the occasional cat video—it’s easy to get trapped.
