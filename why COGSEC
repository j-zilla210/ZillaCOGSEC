👨‍💻 Why I’m Pursuing Cognitive Security
🚀 My Mission
My journey into Cognitive Security is both personal and purposeful. I've always had a deep interest in protecting technology from malicious actors, but the urgency of this mission intensified once I became a parent. Watching my children become curious about the internet made me realize just how vulnerable young users can be online. From exploitation to manipulation, the digital world poses very real threats—and I became determined to ensure my kids navigate it safely.

🧠 Educating Over Restricting
Rather than locking everything down or resorting to constant surveillance, I took a different approach:

I educated my kids about the internet’s risks.

I monitored their activity without invading their privacy.

I built a relationship of trust and open communication, where questions are welcome and curiosity isn’t punished.

This approach empowers my children to become responsible digital citizens, confident enough not only to protect themselves but to help their peers stay safe, too.

🌐 The Bigger Picture
My experience as a parent opened my eyes to the broader need for cyber awareness and digital literacy. I want to help:

Parents who feel overwhelmed by digital threats

Elders or non-tech-savvy users who are afraid to ask questions

Anyone vulnerable to social engineering, scams, or misinformation

Cognitive Security isn’t just about data—it's about people, psychology, and trust.

🎯 My Long-Term Goal
I aim to become your friendly neighborhood Cyber Guy—a trusted voice in the community who helps bridge the gap between people and technology. As I continue to grow in this field, I’ll share what I learn freely with anyone who's willing to listen, read, and understand.

💬 Security is a community effort, and it starts with empathy, awareness, and education.
