# The Internet and Kids – From a Cognitive Security Perspective

This guide aims to help parents understand common online risks like misinformation, manipulation, and exploitation, equipping them with the knowledge to protect their children in the digital age. We'll explore how kids process information, strategies to foster healthy digital habits, and specific threats they might encounter online.

---

## How Kids Process Information Differently Than Adults

Children process information differently than adults due to their developing brains and cognitive abilities. Unlike adults who can think abstractly and critically, children tend to:

* **Think concretely:** They understand what they can directly experience, struggling with abstract ideas and nuanced interpretations.
* **Have limited working memory:** This makes it harder for them to hold and process multiple pieces of information simultaneously.
* **Build schemas and rely on heuristics:** They're actively forming mental frameworks and often use simple shortcuts, sometimes leading to overgeneralizations.
* **Exhibit egocentrism (early childhood):** They may struggle to see perspectives other than their own, impacting their ability to recognize bias.
* **Possess a less developed prefrontal cortex:** This part of the brain is crucial for critical thinking and decision-making, which matures later.
* **Place high trust in adults:** They often take information at face value from trusted figures.

These differences make children more vulnerable to misinformation, especially online. Therefore, it's crucial to help them develop a **"critical lens"** through digital literacy education, focusing on source evaluation, fact-checking, and understanding different content types. Adults should model critical thinking, encourage questions, and co-explore online content with children.

## How to Help Build Cautious but Curious Kids

Encourage curiosity. Let your child ask *lots* of questions. The more they question and explore, the better they become at spotting misinformation.

The most important part? Let them question **you**.

As parents, we make decisions to protect our children, but those decisions—if not explained—can create distance, frustration, and rebellion, especially in pre-teen years. So, it's important we truly try to provide our kids with the space they need. A good way to do that is by following the **Self-Determination Theory**.

# 🧠 Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Kids Exploring the Internet

Self-Determination Theory (SDT), developed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, is a framework for understanding human motivation—especially how we develop agency and confidence. It centers around three core psychological needs:

* **Autonomy** – feeling in control of one's actions and choices
* **Competence** – feeling capable and effective
* **Relatedness** – feeling connected and understood by others

When these needs are supported, kids are more likely to develop confidence, curiosity, and resilience—skills they’ll need to safely navigate the internet.

---

## 🧭 Autonomy – “Let me explore, but guide me.”

Children, especially tweens and teens, crave independence. The internet often becomes their first space for self-directed exploration.

They use it to:

* Search for personal or sensitive questions
* Discover new interests (games, music, fandoms)
* Learn outside the classroom

**The danger?**
Blocking all access can lead to secrecy, resentment, or sneaky behavior. They may go around you rather than come to you.

**What to do instead:**

* Set boundaries with transparency
* Involve them in creating rules
* Allow safe, age-appropriate exploration
* Let them know why certain content is off-limits

---

## 🧠 Competence – “I want to feel smart and capable.”

Kids want to solve problems, master tools, and feel like experts in something.

Online, they:

* Learn new skills (coding, editing, building)
* Watch tutorials and educational content
* Participate in niche communities

**The danger?**
Misinformation or manipulative content can leave them feeling misled or embarrassed.

**What to do instead:**

* Teach critical thinking and fact-checking
* Praise curiosity, not just correct answers
* Encourage them to research from multiple sources

---

## ❤️ Relatedness – “I want to feel seen and connected.”

Many kids seek community online, especially if they feel misunderstood offline.

They find connection through:

* Shared interests (fandoms, games)
* Validation from peers or influencers
* Support groups or identity spaces

**The danger?**
This need can make them vulnerable to echo chambers, toxic behavior, or manipulation.

**What to do instead:**

* Create a home environment where they can talk openly
* Don’t shame them for what they’re curious about
* Check in often, even when nothing seems wrong

### TL;DR Summary: How SDT Applies to Kids on the Internet

| **Psychological Need** | **What Kids Want** | **Risk if Ignored** | **What You Can Do** |
| :--------------------- | :--------------------------- | :------------------------------ | :---------------------------------------- |
| Autonomy               | To explore & make choices    | Secrecy, rebellion              | Offer guided freedom, not full lockdown   |
| Competence             | To feel smart & capable      | Frustration, confusion          | Encourage questions, teach media literacy |
| Relatedness            | To connect & be understood   | Isolation, manipulation, toxic influence | Build trust, be a safe source of connection |

## If You’ve Made It This Far, Do a Little Self-Reflection…

Ask yourself: Do I sometimes dismiss my child's questions? Be honest. It's okay if you don’t always know what to say.

Is it confusion?
Lack of time?
Fear of telling them too much?

Whatever the reason, remember: you want your child to come to you with questions. That’s how you understand what they know, how they think, and how to guide them. It's never too late. You can build—or rebuild—that trust starting *today*. If you can grasp the Self-Determination Theory, it can definitely give you a great outline on where to start.

As parents, we love our kids. So taking this extra time out of our day to truly try to understand them is 100% worth it. You can strengthen your relationship for years to come if you just try and meet them where they are at.

Now, it's important that no matter where you are on your journey with your kids, you understand what to look for and how to inform your kids on internet safety and digital etiquette.

### 🚨 Disclaimer:

The internet can be a chaotic and sometimes disturbing place. While it’s tempting to shield your child completely, over-restriction can backfire and make things more difficult down the line. The examples shared here are intentionally mild—but still meant to raise awareness. As adults and caregivers, it's our responsibility to stay alert, informed, and actively involved in our kids’ digital lives. The goal of this is to provide a balance of curiosity and caution.

I will be outlining some of the main topics: misinformation, manipulation, and exploitation, as well as providing some insight on what to look for in general. As with everything, everyone's situation is different, but the internet is the same no matter where you are.

---

## Understanding Misinformation

> ### Misinformation vs. Disinformation
> * **Misinformation** is the unintentional spread of false or inaccurate information.
> * **Disinformation** is deliberately created to deceive, manipulate, or cause harm.

**Common types of misinformation kids may encounter:**
* Fake news
* YouTube/TikTok conspiracies
* Misleading "educational" content
* Deepfakes and AI-generated videos

---

## Understanding Manipulation

Online manipulation occurs in many forms and can generally be categorized into two types: **Direct** and **Indirect**.

* **Direct Manipulation:** This involves **people who directly reach out to children** to influence or exploit them.
* **Indirect Manipulation:** This refers to **subtle tactics used by content or platforms** to influence kids, such as misleading ads and clickbait.

### Common Types of Direct Manipulation Kids May Encounter:
* Grooming
* Peer Pressure
* Impersonation/Scams
* Bullying and Harassment

### Common Types of Indirect Manipulation Kids May Encounter:
* **Clickbait:** Sensational headlines or thumbnails designed to lure clicks.
* **Fake "Free" offers:** Promises of free items or services that often require personal information or hidden costs.
* **"Advergames":** Games that are essentially interactive advertisements for products or brands.
* **Algorithms & Recommendation Engines:** Automated systems (like those on YouTube and TikTok) that suggest content based on watch history, potentially leading kids to inappropriate material.

### "Dark Patterns" in User Interface Design (a form of Indirect Manipulation):
* **Forced Action:** Design elements that make it difficult for users to opt out of certain actions or settings.
* **Gamification of Spending:** Features like timed offers, loot boxes, or virtual currencies designed to encourage continuous spending.
* **Confirmation Bias:** Algorithms can reinforce a child's existing beliefs by showing them more of what they already agree with, leading to narrow perspectives.

---

## Understanding Exploitation

The term "exploitation" online can be unsettling for any parent, but understanding its forms is vital for protecting our children.

While manipulation often focuses on influencing behavior, **exploitation crosses a line into actively taking advantage of a child for personal gain, harm, or illicit purposes.** This is a severe and often illegal issue that every parent needs to be aware of. If successful, manipulation will most often lead to exploitation.

We can help our kids, and perhaps even influence their friends, by providing the tools necessary to prevent exploitation from happening altogether.

I won't go into extensive detail on the more serious forms of exploitation here. Not only because the content can be explicit, but I want to ensure my content is trauma-informed and provides a space for parents to explore freely and even share with their kids if needed. I will provide resources for parents who are prepared to look further into these more sensitive types of exploitation or who simply wish to be informed.

### Resources for Parents: Understanding Online Exploitation

Below are key organizations and resources that can provide more information and support regarding child online safety and exploitation:

* **National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC)**: [missingkids.org](https://www.missingkids.org/)
    * *Primary resource for reporting suspected child sexual exploitation (CyberTipline) and accessing support services.*
* **Internet Watch Foundation (IWF)**: [iwf.org.uk](https://www.iwf.org.uk/)
    * *UK-based organization focused on eliminating child sexual abuse imagery online; provides valuable resources for parents and carers globally.*
* **Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI)**: [fosi.org](https://www.fosi.org/)
    * *International non-profit dedicated to making the online world safer for kids and families, offering research, resources, and best practices.*
* **Common Sense Media**: [commonsensemedia.org](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/)
    * *Provides reviews of media and technology for families and offers advice on digital well-being and online safety.*

## How Kids Are Misled and Misinformed

Once a child has access to a browser or search engine, their curiosity becomes a gateway. This is the most common way they encounter information they may not be ready for.

### 🚨 Algorithms & Recommendation Engines

Platforms like **YouTube** and **TikTok** use watch history to automatically recommend content. Kids can start with innocent videos and be shown harmful, disturbing, or misleading material just by continuing to watch.

YouTube, in particular, does **not** let you block individual channels on a standard account.

---

### 🔧 Filtering Content on Regular YouTube (Not YouTube Kids)

If you're using the regular YouTube app:

1.  **Enable Restricted Mode**
    Go to `Settings > General > Restricted Mode` to block content flagged as mature.
    > ⚠️ This is not foolproof.

2.  **Turn off auto-play**
    Go to `Settings > Playback > Unselect Autoplay next video`
    > This will prevent the algorithm from being the only thing selecting videos.
    > Gives your kid some autonomy as well on what they would like to watch next.

3.  **Set time limits but tell your kids first!**
    > I will go over this in more detail in a later post, but to summarize: Younger kids don't understand the concept of time. They will watch videos for hours on end and only recognize the day has passed because the sun has gone down. Help them by talking to them about limits and set *reasonable* expectations for what those limits look like.

4.  **Beware of deceptive thumbnails and content**
    * Videos may mimic popular characters or animation styles.
    * Thumbnails may suggest adult content even if the video is tame.
    * Sometimes, suggestive thumbnails are used as bait to redirect viewers elsewhere.

---

## Example of Deceptive Content

This is a real thumbnail from a fan-made video of *The Amazing Digital Circus*—a show popular on Roblox and Netflix.

> ![Blurred preview — sensitive content warning](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05bd2861-4dda-4bf1-b2db-e315265a72e2)
> ⚠️ This image is blurred due to potentially sensitive content.
> Click [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ef65dfd-d3fa-4089-8ec5-ae42489e7b8b) to view the original.

The video isn’t explicit—but the thumbnail is suggestive. Why? Because the creator links to **18+ content** hosted on other platforms.

This "marketing" tactic is designed to generate curiosity, traffic, and conversions. But for kids, it can cause **confusion**, **premature exposure**, and start **unhealthy viewing habits**. The worst part is that you cannot block accounts from being accessed. So if your kid wants to watch Digital Circus content, they may eventually be redirected back to these videos. If you do notice videos like these, report them. That is really the only way to try and prevent them from being accessed.

---

## Other Notorious Examples

Deceptive content isn't limited to obscure videos. Some of the most well-known cases involve fake or disturbing versions of popular children’s shows:

* *Dark Peppa Pig* videos
* Fake *Bluey* clips involving injury, death, or violence

These videos often avoid removal by disguising themselves or re-uploading in different forms. Even after one is taken down, another usually takes its place.

---

Continuing with kids being misled or misinformed, these instances can happen most often from people in your child's inner circles: friends and family alike.

### 📱 Messaging Apps & Group Chats (Including FaceTime)

Platforms like **Discord**, **Snapchat**, **WhatsApp**, **iMessage**, and **FaceTime** support group chats, media sharing, and video calls. These platforms are essential for how kids socialize today—but they can also expose them to unsafe or inappropriate content.

**Common risks include:**
* Inappropriate memes or jokes
* Peer pressure challenges
* Rumors or gossip
* Bullying or harassment

Many of these platforms offer **encrypted** or **disappearing messages**, which makes them difficult (or impossible) to monitor.

> 🛑 _Personal opinion:_ **Snapchat and other encrypted messaging apps are a hard no** in our home—at least until my kids develop stronger digital literacy and emotional awareness. Mostly because there really is no way to safeguard those apps. They are not intended for children in any way. (With the exception of WhatsApp, since that is used very often to talk to family in other countries. But normally a parent or adult would provide that opportunity.)

---

> 💬 **Encourage ongoing conversations about digital etiquette, consent, and boundaries.** Let your child know they can show you anything that feels “off” or uncomfortable—without fear of getting in trouble.

---

### 👄 Example: Swearing and Offensive Language

Let’s be real: **kids are going to encounter swearing.** It happens in games, movies, and conversations with friends. Some kids find it funny. Some think it makes them sound more grown-up. But this curiosity can spiral quickly.

**It can lead to:**
* Discovering and repeating slurs or hate speech
* Group chats filled with offensive "jokes"
* Bullying or targeted harassment at school or online

Your child might be added to a group chat where offensive language is used just for laughs—often because kids know those messages disappear or go unmonitored.

---

### 🧠 How I Talk to My Kids About It

Instead of pretending bad words don’t exist, I ask my kids to think critically about **context and impact**:

* Are you using this to hurt someone?
* Are you repeating it just because it sounds “cool”?
* How do you feel when you hear or see that word?

These aren’t one-time lectures—they’re **ongoing check-ins** that help build empathy and media literacy. My goal isn’t to scare my kids—it’s to **equip them**.

---

> 👪 _Remember:_ You can’t always control what your child hears—but you can **influence how they process it.**

Speaking of what your child may hear...

### 🎮 Online Gaming Platforms (Roblox, Fortnite, Minecraft, etc.)

Games today are not just games—they're **social platforms.** Kids chat, form groups, trade items, and stream content in real time. Popular games like **Roblox**, **Fortnite**, **Minecraft**, and **Call of Duty** all include social features that can expose kids to risks.

**Risks include:**
* In-game voice/text chat with strangers
* Exposure to mature or violent content
* Grooming or manipulative behavior from older users
* Scams involving virtual currency or items
* Toxic or offensive language

Some platforms have **parental controls** or **chat filters**, but they’re not foolproof. Many kids quickly learn how to bypass these restrictions—or move to external platforms like Discord for unfiltered communication.

---

### 🧠 What to Watch For

Even when your child is “just playing a game,” they may be:
* Hearing racial slurs or offensive jokes
* Getting messages from strangers posing as peers
* Learning about adult topics from older players
* Feeling pressured to spend real money

Many of these environments also reward **risk-taking and status-seeking**, which can fuel impulsive behavior and exposure to inappropriate content.

---

### 🛡️ What You Can Do

* **Play the games yourself** (or at least sit in during sessions).
* **Check voice/chat settings** and disable open communication if possible.
* **Review friend lists** and in-game purchases regularly.
* **Ask questions like:**
    * “What’s the funniest thing that happened in the game today?”
    * “Did anyone say something that made you uncomfortable?”
    * “Would you tell me if someone asked you to keep a secret online?”

---

> 👂 The goal isn’t to spy—it’s to stay connected. When kids know you're curious about their world (not just controlling it), they’re more likely to come to you when something feels off.

---

> 🔐 **Pro Tip:** If a game allows it, **turn off public chat** and use invite-only private servers or friend lists you’ve helped curate. Also, Play with your kids! Roblox and Fortnite are a blast. My child lights up when we play together.

---

## Final Thoughts

The internet is filled with incredible resources—but it also harbors misinformation, manipulation, and exploitation.

By building open lines of communication with your child, encouraging curiosity, and staying aware of online risks, you’re giving them the tools to safely navigate the digital world.

Let curiosity be their compass—and you be their guide.
