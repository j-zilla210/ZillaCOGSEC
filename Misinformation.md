# Misinformation and Kids – From a Cognitive Security Perspective

## Understanding Misinformation

> **Misinformation vs. Disinformation**
> - *Misinformation* is the unintentional spread of false or inaccurate information.  
> - *Disinformation* is deliberately created to deceive, manipulate, or cause harm.

**Common types of misinformation kids may encounter:**
- Fake news  
- YouTube/TikTok conspiracies  
- Misleading "educational" content  
- Deepfakes and AI-generated videos

## How Kids Process Information Differently Than Adults

Adults develop critical thinking through life experience and education. But since everyone’s background varies, ideas of what's "true" can differ widely. We see this in debates over science, history, and values.

Children, by contrast, are still forming their sense of skepticism. They often take information at face value—especially from adults they trust. That’s why it’s so important to help them develop a critical lens when they begin exploring the internet.

## How to Help Build Non-Biased, Curious Kids

Encourage curiosity. Let your child ask *lots* of questions. The more they question and explore, the better they become at spotting misinformation.

The most important part? Let them question **you**.

As parents, we make decisions to protect them, but those decisions—if not explained—can create distance, frustration, and rebellion, especially in pre-teen years.
So it is important we really try to provide our kids with that space they need.
A good way to do that is following the "Self-Determination Theory"

# 🧠 Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Kids Exploring the Internet

Self-Determination Theory (SDT), developed by Edward Deci and Richard Ryan, is a framework for understanding human motivation—especially how we develop agency and confidence. It centers around three core psychological needs:

- **Autonomy** – feeling in control of one's actions and choices  
- **Competence** – feeling capable and effective  
- **Relatedness** – feeling connected and understood by others  

When these needs are supported, kids are more likely to develop confidence, curiosity, and resilience—skills they’ll need to safely navigate the internet.

## 🧭 Autonomy – “Let me explore, but guide me.”

Children, especially tweens and teens, crave independence. The internet often becomes their first space for self-directed exploration.

They use it to:

- Search for personal or sensitive questions  
- Discover new interests (games, music, fandoms)  
- Learn outside the classroom  

**The danger?**  
Blocking all access can lead to secrecy, resentment, or sneaky behavior. They may go around you rather than come to you.

**What to do instead:**

- Set boundaries with transparency  
- Involve them in creating rules  
- Allow safe, age-appropriate exploration  
- Let them know why certain content is off-limits  

---

## 🧠 Competence – “I want to feel smart and capable.”

Kids want to solve problems, master tools, and feel like experts in something.

Online, they:

- Learn new skills (coding, editing, building)  
- Watch tutorials and educational content  
- Participate in niche communities  

**The danger?**  
Misinformation or manipulative content can leave them feeling misled or embarrassed.

**What to do instead:**

- Teach critical thinking and fact-checking  
- Praise curiosity, not just correct answers  
- Encourage them to research from multiple sources  

---

## ❤️ Relatedness – “I want to feel seen and connected.”

Many kids seek community online, especially if they feel misunderstood offline.

They find connection through:

- Shared interests (fandoms, games)  
- Validation from peers or influencers  
- Support groups or identity spaces  

**The danger?**  
This need can make them vulnerable to echo chambers, toxic behavior, or manipulation.

**What to do instead:**

- Create a home environment where they can talk openly  
- Don’t shame them for what they’re curious about  
- Check in often, even when nothing seems wrong  

###TL;DR summary how SDT applies to kids on the internet###

| **Psychological Need** | **What Kids Want**         | **Risk if Ignored**                      | **What You Can Do**                         |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Autonomy               | To explore & make choices  | Secrecy, rebellion                       | Offer guided freedom, not full lockdown     |
| Competence             | To feel smart & capable    | Frustration, confusion                   | Encourage questions, teach media literacy   |
| Relatedness            | To connect & be understood | Isolation, manipulation, toxic influence | Build trust, be a safe source of connection |

## If You’ve Made It This Far do a little self reflection…

Ask yourself: Do I sometimes dismiss my child's questions? Be honest. It's okay if you don’t always know what to say.

Is it confusion?  
Lack of time?  
Fear of telling them too much?

Whatever the reason, remember: you want your child to come to you with questions.  
That’s how you understand what they know, how they think, and how to guide them.

You can build—or rebuild—that trust starting *today*.
But what exactly should we be looking out for?

### 🚨 Disclaimer:
The internet can be a chaotic and sometimes disturbing place. While it’s tempting to shield your child completely, over-restriction can backfire and make things more difficult down the line.
The examples shared here are intentionally mild—but still meant to raise awareness. As adults and caregivers, it's our responsibility to stay alert, informed, and actively involved in our kids’ digital lives.
The goal of this is to provide a balance of curiosity and caution

## How Kids Are Exposed

Once a child has access to a browser or search engine, their curiosity becomes a gateway. This is the most common way they encounter information they may not be ready for.

### 🚨 Algorithms & Recommendation Engines

Platforms like **YouTube** and **TikTok** use watch history to automatically recommend content. Kids can start with innocent videos and be shown harmful, disturbing, or misleading material just by continuing to watch.

YouTube, in particular, does **not** let you block individual channels on a standard account.

---

### 🔧 Filtering Content on Regular YouTube (Not YouTube Kids)

If you're using the regular YouTube app:

1. **Enable Restricted Mode**  
   Go to `Settings > General > Restricted Mode` to block content flagged as mature.  
   > ⚠️ This is not foolproof.
   
2. **Turn off auto-play**
   Go to `Settings > Playback > Unselect Autoplay next video`
   > This will prevent the algorithm from being the only thing selecting videos.
   > Gives your kid some autonamy as well on what they would like to watch next.
    
3. **Set time limits but tell your kids first!**
   > I will go over this in more detail in a later post, but to summarize, Your younger kids don't understand the concept of time. They will watch videos for hours on end and only recognize the day has passed because the sun has gone down. Help them by talking to them about limits and set *reasonable* expectations for what those limits look like.

4. **Beware of deceptive thumbnails and content**  
   - Videos may mimic popular characters or animation styles.  
   - Thumbnails may suggest adult content even if the video is tame.  
   - Sometimes, suggestive thumbnails are used as bait to redirect viewers elsewhere.

---

## Example of Deceptive Content

This is a real thumbnail from a fan-made video of *The Amazing Digital Circus*—a show popular on Roblox and Netflix.

> ![Blurred preview — sensitive content warning](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05bd2861-4dda-4bf1-b2db-e315265a72e2)  
> ⚠️ This image is blurred due to potentially sensitive content.  
> Click [here](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ef65dfd-d3fa-4089-8ec5-ae42489e7b8b) to view the original.

The video isn’t explicit—but the thumbnail is suggestive. Why? Because the creator links to **18+ content** hosted on other platforms.

This "marketing" tactic is designed to generate curiosity, traffic, and conversions. But for kids, it can cause **confusion**, **premature exposure**, and start **unhealthy viewing habits**.

---

## Other Notorious Examples

Deceptive content isn't limited to obscure videos. Some of the most well-known cases involve fake or disturbing versions of popular children’s shows:

- *Dark Peppa Pig* videos  
- Fake *Bluey* clips involving injury, death, or violence

These videos often avoid removal by disguising themselves or re-uploading in different forms. Even after one is taken down, another usually takes its place.

---

### 📱 Messaging Apps & Group Chats (Including FaceTime)

Platforms like **Discord**, **Snapchat**, **WhatsApp**, **iMessage**, and **FaceTime** support group chats, media sharing, and video calls. These platforms are essential for how kids socialize today—but they can also expose them to unsafe or inappropriate content.

**Common risks include:**
- Inappropriate memes or jokes
- Peer pressure challenges
- Rumors or gossip
- Bullying or harassment

Many of these platforms offer **encrypted** or **disappearing messages**, which makes them difficult (or impossible) to monitor.

> 🛑 _Personal opinion:_ **Snapchat and other encrypted messaging apps are a hard no** in our home—at least until my kids develop stronger digital literacy and emotional awareness. MOstly because there really is no way to safe-guard those apps. They are not intended for children in any way. (With the exception of WhatsApp, since that is used very often to talk to family in other countries, But normally a parent or adult would provide that opportunity)

---

> 💬 **Encourage ongoing conversations about digital etiquette, consent, and boundaries.** Let your child know they can show you anything that feels “off” or uncomfortable—without fear of getting in trouble.

---

### 👄 Example: Swearing and Offensive Language

Let’s be real: **kids are going to encounter swearing.** It happens in games, movies, and conversations with friends. Some kids find it funny. Some think it makes them sound more grown-up. But this curiosity can spiral quickly.

**It can lead to:**
- Discovering and repeating slurs or hate speech
- Group chats filled with offensive "jokes"
- Bullying or targeted harassment at school or online

Your child might be added to a group chat where offensive language is used just for laughs—often because kids know those messages disappear or go unmonitored.

---

### 🧠 How I Talk to My Kids About It

Instead of pretending bad words don’t exist, I ask my kids to think critically about **context and impact**:

- Are you using this to hurt someone?
- Are you repeating it just because it sounds “cool”?
- How do you feel when you hear or see that word?

These aren’t one-time lectures—they’re **ongoing check-ins** that help build empathy and media literacy. My goal isn’t to scare my kids—it’s to **equip them**.

---

> 👪 _Remember:_ You can’t always control what your child hears—but you can **influence how they process it.**

Speaking of what your child may hear. 

### 🎮 Online Gaming Platforms (Roblox, Fortnite, Minecraft, etc.)

Games today are not just games—they're **social platforms.** Kids chat, form groups, trade items, and stream content in real time. Popular games like **Roblox**, **Fortnite**, **Minecraft**, and **Call of Duty** all include social features that can expose kids to risks.

**Risks include:**
- In-game voice/text chat with strangers
- Exposure to mature or violent content
- Grooming or manipulative behavior from older users
- Scams involving virtual currency or items
- Toxic or offensive language

Some platforms have **parental controls** or **chat filters**, but they’re not foolproof. Many kids quickly learn how to bypass these restrictions—or move to external platforms like Discord for unfiltered communication.

---

### 🧠 What to Watch For

Even when your child is “just playing a game,” they may be:
- Hearing racial slurs or offensive jokes
- Getting messages from strangers posing as peers
- Learning about adult topics from older players
- Feeling pressured to spend real money

Many of these environments also reward **risk-taking and status-seeking**, which can fuel impulsive behavior and exposure to inappropriate content.

---

### 🛡️ What You Can Do

- **Play the games yourself** (or at least sit in during sessions).
- **Check voice/chat settings** and disable open communication if possible.
- **Review friend lists** and in-game purchases regularly.
- **Ask questions like:**
  - “What’s the funniest thing that happened in the game today?”
  - “Did anyone say something that made you uncomfortable?”
  - “Would you tell me if someone asked you to keep a secret online?”

---

> 👂 The goal isn’t to spy—it’s to stay connected. When kids know you're curious about their world (not just controlling it), they’re more likely to come to you when something feels off.

---

> 🔐 **Pro Tip:** If a game allows it, **turn off public chat** and use invite-only private servers or friend lists you’ve helped curate. Also, Play with your kids! Roblox and Fortnite are a blast. My child lights up when we play together.




## Final Thoughts

The internet is filled with incredible resources—but it also harbors misinformation, manipulation, and exploitation.

By building open lines of communication with your child, encouraging curiosity, and staying aware of online risks, you’re giving them the tools to safely navigate the digital world.

Let curiosity be their compass—and you be their guide.
