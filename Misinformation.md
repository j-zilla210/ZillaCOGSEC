## How kids process information differently than adults
Typically, adults learn critical thinking skills throughout life, we know this is not always true
but compared to children we will say they are.
What kids lack is a sense of skepticism, adults have used this to their advantage in many ways, for some good, but also bad.
kids look up to their parents and other adults for guidence so it is easy, although horrible, to mislead kids.
It is important that while kids develop these skills, when it comes to the internet and technology, we must ensure
that they learn that just because you heard it on Youtube or Tiktok, doesn't mean it is real.
Though it can take some time for kids to understand the difference.
The best way to combat that, have your kids ask you questions. LOTS of questions.
The sooner they question things, the quicker they will develop critical thinking skills.

### How kids are exposed
When your child has access to a browser or any search engine. It is easy for them to get curious and look up things.
This is typically the easiest way for them to be exposed to things they should otherwise not be seeing or reading.
> Algorithms and recommendation engines
These types of engines produce information without having them input any information, most of it is based off of their content.
This is most often seen on Tiktok and Youtube. As they view content, they will be given ads or provided random content based on their
previosuly veiwed videos.
The danger of this, is that with Youtube specifically, you can not block Youtube channels.
> There are 2 ways to try to filter content for kids on the Regular Youtube (not kids youtube)
In "Settings > General" there is an option to "Restrict" content. Meaning that any content that is rated mature will be blocked from viewing.
Though, this is not full proof. If you have not already heard, there are plenty of Youtube channels that look like kids videos, but are very much mature material.
OR the content video cover insinuates explicitness, but the actual video itself never shows what is happening in the video cover.
