🧠 Path to Cognitive Security
Welcome! This repository documents my journey into Cognitive Security, a growing intersection of cybersecurity, psychology, and social engineering defense. Here, I’ll share my learning, research, projects, and experiments—especially around understanding and mitigating the human-focused attacks that traditional security controls often miss.

👤 About Me
🎓 B.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance

🎓 Career Certificate in Information Technology Security and Administration

💼 Background in cybersecurity fundamentals with hands-on experience in both theory and technical administration

🐧 Comfortable working in Linux environments

📊 Currently learning Data Analytics to better understand trends, behaviors, and anomalies

🔒 Sharpening practical cybersecurity skills through Hack The Box (SOC Analyst Path)

🧠 Interested in Social Engineering and how attackers exploit cognitive biases, emotions, and decision-making processes

💭 Long-term goal: Build, test, and contribute to systems that detect, analyze, and counter cognitive attacks (like phishing, misinformation, etc.)

🔥 Motivation
My passion for cognitive security is deeply personal. My family is my driving force—especially watching how:

🧒 Children are exposed to technology at younger ages, often without the skills to protect themselves from manipulation or harm.

👵 Older adults struggle with increasingly complex digital tools, making them prime targets for scams, fraud, and misinformation.

Technology is becoming inseparable from daily life, and I want to be part of the solution—helping make digital spaces safer and more intuitive for those most at risk.

🔍 What This Repo Will Cover
This GitHub repo will serve as a living document, tracking my self-study, thoughts, and findings on topics like:

🎭 Common Social Engineering Techniques and how they manipulate trust, fear, urgency, etc.

🧩 Psychological principles behind successful attacks (Cialdini’s principles, pretexting, etc.)

🛡️ Mitigation strategies and user education techniques

🔧 Tools and scripts to analyze or simulate human-focused attacks

🔬 Case studies and breakdowns of real-world attacks

📂 Learning resources, notes, and project ideas

📌 Goals Build a strong knowledge base of cognitive attack vectors

Develop practical projects around human-centric cybersecurity

Explore ways to integrate data analytics with cognitive security defense

Eventually contribute to real-world research, red/blue team efforts, or behavioral defense systems
