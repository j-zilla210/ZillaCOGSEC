### The Importance of MFA

Multifactor authentication is the best safety net to prevent account compromise. Today, usernames and passwords are often revealed through breaches in all sorts of places.
Attackers also know that most people re-use their passwords across multiple websites putting all of their accounts at risk of compromise. 

To put it into persepctive, lets use the front door to a home. 
Typically people have 2 locks, bolt and door handle, those can be thought of as where you enter your username and password.
You have 1 key ( your username and password )
If someone were to get a hold of your key, they have access to your home.
How can you ensure the safety of your home?  You could incorporate a Secondary lock with a passcode.
This way, even with the first key, someone who has it would still need the passcode to bypass your secondary lock.

Depending on the website or app, different types of MFA are available.
 - Text message
 - phone call
 - email
 - Authenticator app

## Compormised account example

In today's example I will go over account compromises.

Recently Microsoft Defender alerted to a few accounts during an active password spray attack. It was about 6 accounts that were consistently being targetted.
One account was said to be compromised, and after looking into the account I saw that their password was being used successfuly, after the second successful login the account was locked.
