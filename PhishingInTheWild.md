### Actual examples of phishing I see in the wild, and how to spot them.

A more recent type of phishing attempt that I and my partner have seen are these emails that are alerting you of some sort of "cloud sync" billing error or passed due issue.

The one I will be documenting below is one that is pretty obvious, but none the less a good example to peel apart

these emails also include a few attachments (which I will not be downloading, because I know for a fact that the attachments have malware. Especially the PDFs which most definitely have javascripts

I also saw they have a few addresses "701 Tillery Street Austin, TX 78702" and "987 backup Lane denver, CO 80205"

The Austin Texas address is for a shared co-working space, not a "Graphics Designs Logos" company. 
The Denver address does not exist.

We started to recieve these emails right before the weekend hit, and my partner was hit with quite a few. Which didn't go directly to spam. I had a few in spam.
These emails all looked sort of like one another, except no specific company was mentioned. We have Google, One Drive and Apple cloud storage. We were waiting for pay day to pay one of them off, so initially my partner thought it was legit.
Though they did not click through the email to check.

#### Never click through emails to get to websites that you are a user of

If you legitimetly have an account for some kind of service. Go to their direct home page and login through there. This way, if you did receieve a malicious email, this bypasses that and you can get a legitimate answer.
Example: you get an email from your mortgage lender stating "Your payment did not go through this month and you need to click this link to pay"

Your first thought is "wait I know I paid it" but, what if there was a mistake? You will want to find the quickest way into your account. If the email is open it may seem like this is the fastest way, especially if you are on your phone.

That is where most phishing attempts are the most effective, when we are distressed or panicked.

With any email, text message or phone call, please stop and verify. (for this scenario) 
 - Check your bank statements. If you paid it, you will need to find the proof first (if there actually was a mistake)
 - Contact your mortgage lender. Find their legit website or phone number and talk to them directly.
With this you can avoid even having to interact with the email at all.

*** also let the company know. They also have an interest in knowing when their customers are being phished. If the payments end up going to someone else, they are also losing out. ***

These scenarios happen often. So it is a good idea to always be vigilent and second guess that "URGENT" email.
