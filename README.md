## 🧠 Path to Cognitive Security
Welcome! This repository documents my journey into Cognitive Security, a growing intersection of cybersecurity, psychology, and social engineering defense. Here, I’ll share my learning, research, projects, and experiments—especially around understanding and mitigating the human-focused attacks that traditional security controls often miss.

## Professional Statement

**I bring strong written and verbal communication skills that help bridge the gap between technical solutions and everyday understanding. I believe everyone deserves safe access to the internet, regardless of their background or technical knowledge. My goal is to make cybersecurity more approachable and protective for all users, especially those who need it most.**

## 👤 About Me
 - 🎓 B.S. in Cybersecurity and Information Assurance

 - 🎓 Career Certificate in Information Technology Security and Administration

 - 💼 Background in cybersecurity fundamentals with hands-on experience in both theory and technical administration

 - 🐧 Comfortable working in Linux environments

 - 📊 Currently learning Data Analytics to better understand trends, behaviors, and anomalies

 - 🔒 Sharpening practical cybersecurity skills through Hack The Box (SOC Analyst Path)

 - 🧠 Interested in Social Engineering and how attackers exploit cognitive biases, emotions, and decision-making processes

 - 💭 Long-term goal: Build, test, and contribute to systems that detect, analyze, and counter cognitive attacks (like phishing, misinformation, etc.)

## 🔥 Motivation
My passion for cognitive security is deeply personal. My family is my driving force—especially watching how:

 - 🧒 Children are exposed to technology at younger ages, often without the skills to protect themselves from manipulation or harm.

 - 👵 Older adults struggle with increasingly complex digital tools, making them prime targets for scams, fraud, and misinformation.

**Technology is becoming inseparable from daily life, and I want to be part of the solution—helping make digital spaces safer and more intuitive for those most at risk.**

## 🔍 What This Repo Will Cover
**This GitHub repo will serve as a living document, tracking my self-study, thoughts, and findings on topics like:**

 - 🎭 Common Social Engineering Techniques and how they manipulate trust, fear, urgency, etc.

 - 🧩 Psychological principles behind successful attacks (Cialdini’s principles, pretexting, etc.)

 - 🛡️ Mitigation strategies and user education techniques

 - 🔧 Tools and scripts to analyze or simulate human-focused attacks

 - 🔬 Case studies and breakdowns of real-world attacks

 - 📂 Learning resources, notes, and project ideas

 ## 📌 Goals Build a strong knowledge base of cognitive attack vectors

**Develop practical projects around human-centric cybersecurity**

**Explore ways to integrate data analytics with cognitive security defense**

**Eventually contribute to real-world research, red/blue team efforts, or behavioral defense systems**
